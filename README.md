# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning<br>

## Overview<br>
This project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using deep learning techniques with the MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate neural network models to classify digits from images and explore enhancements in model performance.<br>

## Dataset<br>
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.<br>


## Getting Started<br>

### Prerequisites<br>
Ensure you have the following installed:<br>
- Python 3.x<br>
- TensorFlow<br>
- Keras<br>
- NumPy<br>
- Matplotlib<br>

### Running the Project<br>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in Google Colab.<br>
2. Run the cells in the Jupyter notebook to:<br>
   - Load and visualize the dataset.<br>
   - Prepare the data for training.<br>
   - Build and evaluate a neural network model.<br>
   - Experiment with enhancements for improved accuracy.<br>

### Features<br>
- Manual flattening of images to prepare for model training.<br>
- A simple neural network model without hidden layers.<br>
- A more complex model with one hidden layer and an activation function.<br>
- Evaluation of model performance and predictions.<br>

## Results<br>
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately **92%** initially, which improved to **93%** after enhancements. Detailed evaluation metrics can be found within the notebook.<br>

## Contributing<br>
Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests for any improvements or enhancements!<br>
